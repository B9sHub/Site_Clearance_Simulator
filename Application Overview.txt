I have designed this application into 2 main classes and a main() to execute simulator

The SiteSimulator class is the interface between the end user and the cli
The SiteOperations class is the logic behind the functionality after the user has entered the command

All the variables are private to the SiteOperations class but contain public methods to return to the SiteSimulator as a display

I have used ArrayLists to enable flexible accomodation of the inputs such as site map square values and for length of rows

This is converted to a 2 dimensional array for ease of updating the square status as I continously update the current x y co-ordinates

To launch the application I created a .bat file to allow me to launch from my Windows laptop.
Simply double-click the LaunchSiteSimulator.bat to enter the command line window.
The instructions will be printed on screen

I have summarised the lof=gic below

Application Workflow

a) Launch Simulator to enter Interactive Console
b) Pass in the ground layout
c) Plot the site on cli
d) Pass in an instruction on cli: 
	Advance(int number of steps in current direction)
	Left: Turn 90* to the left
	Right: Turn 90* to the right
	Quit: Exit program
	Represent the current position by either N.E.W.S.
e) Detect exit criteria
f) Caluculate and store operation costs
g) Print out when simulator exits
